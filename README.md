# Hotel Website Project
This project had me working with a Spring framework application built with an Angular front end to add additional functionality to the website. I utilized Spring Boot to add features such as translations, currency conversions, and additional UX to the website's frontend. Docker was then used to host the application to showcase cloud-base hosting.
